  MicroCloud can automatically configure LXD, Ceph, and OVN across a set of servers.
  It relies on mDNS to automatically detect other servers on the network, making it possible
  to set up a complete cluster by running a single command on one of the machines.

  MicroCloud creates a small footprint cluster of compute nodes with distributed
  storage and secure networking, optimized for repeatable, reliable remote deployments.
  MicroCloud is aimed at edge computing, and anyone in need of a small-scale private cloud.
resources:
  microcloud-binary:
    type: file
    filename: microcloud
    description: |
      A debug version of the MicroCloud binary or a tarball of architecture specific
      binaries. In the case of a tarball, the binaries should be at the root
      and be named as "microcloud_${ARCH}".

      Attaching an empty file will undo the sideloading.
  microcloud-snap:
    type: file
    filename: microcloud.snap
    description: |
      A custom MicroCloud snap or tarball of architecture specific snaps to install.
      In the case of a tarball, the snaps should be at the root and be
      named as "microcloud_${ARCH}.snap".

      Attaching an empty file will undo the sideloading.
